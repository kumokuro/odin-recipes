# odin-recipes
This project is apart of The Odin Project Curriculum.

Welcome to this simple website featuring recipes from one of my favorite cuisines - Japanese! Japanese food is popular worldwide for its many flavorful dishes. Japanese cooking has roots in Buddhist practices, and includes a mindful, delicate balance of flavors. There is an appreciation for each of the four seasons and food is made accordingly. This creates thoughtfully crafted dishes with ingredients used at the peak of their freshness. No wonder it is so loved by many!

This project demonstrates an understanding of fundamental HTML and CSS. It also provides practice in using best practices for file structure.
