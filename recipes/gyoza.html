    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Gyoza (餃子)</em>, sometimes referred to as potstickers, are small
      pan-fried dumplings typically filled with pork, but can also be found in a
      variety of flavors. These tiny joys actually have their origins in China,
      and has lasted the test of time in Japan as a favorite snack in
      <em>izakayas</em>. The Japanese versions are a little bit smaller, with a
      thinner skin which allows for a perfectly crisp bottom.
