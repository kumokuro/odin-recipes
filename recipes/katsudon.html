    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Katsudon</em> is a type of <em>donburi (丼)</em>, which translates
      literally to bowl, and refers to both the actual bowl used to serve this
      type of dish as well as the meal inside. <em>Katsudon</em> is a deep fried
      pork cutlet, bathed in a savory onion-egg mixture before being placed on a
      bed of rice. <em>Katsudon</em> is also commonly prepared with chicken,
      which this recipe will feature. Fun fact: It is considered good luck to
      eat a bowl of <em>katsudon</em> before an exam!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Chicken Katsu:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Sea salt</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>3 cups vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Katsudon:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 thinly-sliced onion</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1.5 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Seasoning blend:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the chicken tender with salt and pepper. Coat the chicken with
        flour, beaten egg (use 1 egg), and the panko in that order.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2-3 cups oil in a frying pan and shallow-fry the panko-coated
        chicken at 350ºF (180ºC) until golden brown. Take out the chicken and
        drain extra oil on a paper towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another (or a clean) frying pan, add sliced onion and all the
        ingredients for the katsudon seasonings. Cover and bring it to a boil
        over medium heat. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium and cook the
        onion, covered, until wilted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put chicken katsu over the onion and turn the heat up to medium-high
        heat. Evenly distribute the beaten egg (use 2 eggs) over the chicken
        katsu and onion. Cover to cook until the egg is set to your liking,
        roughly 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Turn off the heat. Transfer to a bowl of steamed rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
